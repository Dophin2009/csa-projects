Your character has an 'evade', 'burst', and 'ultimate' ability. You can
activate abilities when the cooldown the bottom right corner reaches 0.
To use evade, press F; to use burst, press Q; to use the ultimate
ability, press E. I guess you can find out for yourself what these
abilities do as you play.

At the end of the game a shabby leaderboard I bodged together at the
last moment will show up.

Have fun.
